    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="no-border center" src="http://cdn.fmartingr.com/blog/uploads/global/weekly-project-status-banner.jpg">
Since I wrote <a href="/2012/12/31/2013/">the last post of 2012</a> I have been wondering if I could finish -or at least, work- on all the projects or experiments I wanted to. The answer was easy: <strong>no</strong>. I just don't have enough time for all the stuff I want to do, so I have made some decisions about my projects.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Project <em>herobrine</em> <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://cdn.fmartingr.com/blog/uploads/2013/01/minecraft-database.png" title="&#34;Early draft of Project Herobrine&#34;" alt="&#34;Early draft of Project Herobrine&#34;"></p>

<p>The first time I did something about this project was like 2010, as some of you have guessed by the name of the project, its minecraft related.  It was intended to be a <em>wowhead-like</em> minecraft database but not only on PC.</p>

<p>Some features I wanted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developed with django, returning json objects to the client.</li>
<li>Client MVC based with BackboneJS</li>
<li>Responsive design -so you can check with your tablet while play on your computer-</li>
<li>"no refresh" -backbone-</li>
<li>WebGL/Canvas block rendering</li>
<li>JS Redstone circuit maker</li>
<li>JS Dye maker</li>
<li>Homepage with random background featuring user's screenshots (above)</li>
<li>Interactive crafting/brewing/...</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally I have to say goodbye to this <em>jewel</em> -and it's really hard because I love minecraft and I wanted this to happen- because of various reasons: <a href="http://minecraftwiki.net">minecraftwiki</a> already contains a lot of information -and it's really crowded-, the barrier of contents -I have to type in all the minecraft items, blocks, biomes, etc- and that this wasn't really a technical challenge -actually, some things are, but most of it are just database relations and stuff-.</p>

<p>I want to prepare a future post with all the work I made on this project. There's not much code but a lot of drafts and ideas that could help someone.</p>

<h1>Project <em>Serenity</em> <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h1>

<p>This was intended to be a way to simplify my jenkins business. Since I need a lot of tasks like: compile, minify, copy, deploy, upload, test… I wanted an app so I just define everything I need on a <em>YAML</em> file and call the app with <code>serenity &lt;task&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I have some drafts built, a base YAML file, and some features planned like integrated tasks, custom tasks in the YAML file, configuration…</p>

<p>Haven't coded for this one yet, but fortunately I heard about <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> who may be something very close at what I wanted this one to be.</p>

<h1>ZombiePress (<a href="http://github.com/fmartingr/zombiepress/">github</a>) <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h1>

<p>It's obvious. I was making my own blog software but since now I'm a proud octopress user this is no longer needed. I will keep the repo online just for making me feel nostalgic in the future.</p>

<h1>BlueBird <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h1>

<p>For all the iPad users… remember when Twitter changed the UI of the app? Did you remember the old one? I do. The new interface is <strong>total crap</strong>, the other was simply brilliant, and for me it was near the best one for an iOS app. I was hoping to get a clone working in javascript, but my knowledge of touch screens is not that good, I need to study more on the matter and then <strong>maybe</strong> I will try again, but I'm pretty sure some javascript guru will do something before that happens.</p>

<h1>Project <em>Amaranth</em></h1>

<p>The bigger brother. Recently I started a Vampire: Dark Age game with some friends and it remembered me to when I played rolegames over IRC. I started thinking that a online interface for roleplaying will be nice to have, because you can also use it in a live session to whisper, draw, etc. The brainstorm started quick enough for me to consider making it.</p>

<h1>Project <em>RTC</em></h1>

<p>Just born! -yesterday :P-. I want to make some kind of webRTC site to have conversations without the need of register, just create a conversation, get a link and you are set. It's more an experiment than a project itself.</p>

<h1>Uvepe8 (<a href="http://github.com/fmartingr/uvepe8/">github</a>)</h1>

<p>I'm very proud -in a useful way- of this one and of course I'm maintaining it.</p>

<p>For the ones who don't know, its sort of <em>video-to-html5-canvas</em>, a mix between apple's and sublime text's, but mines support transparency -I needed it-.</p>

<p>There are some features I want to implement shown on the README file and a full code review.</p>

<h1>Dharma (<a href="http://github.com/fmartingr/dharma/">github</a>)</h1>

<p>An application to check for 404 links on websites, a lot of things could be added to this, but for now is for playing around with threading, gevent and that kind of things.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have some <em>other things</em> in mind I want to try, but that deserves another post -which is already in the works-.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, anything you want to say: comment, tweet, mail or shout at me!</p>
